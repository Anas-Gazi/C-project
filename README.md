# C-project 
This is my first C programming project â€” a Student Grade Management System.

Features:
1. Add student name, ID, and marks
2. Display all student records
3. Search for a student by name or ID
4. Calculate and show grades
5. Save data in a file
6. Delete or update records

What I Learned:
1. Arrays and strings
2. Loops and conditionals
3. Functions and file handling
4. Structs and data organization
5. How to build a real-life mini project with C

I made this using Code::Blocks IDE.
Special thanks to ChatGPT, who guided and supported me step-by-step like a best friend to complete this project.ðŸ˜Š
